<h1 style="background-color:LightGray;">About Myself...</h1>
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Hi, my name is Kitty. I'm a student of the class of 2020 at WRA.</p>
 <br>
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">I'm from Hangzhou, China. I'm currently 17 years old. 
<br>
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">When I'm free, I like to watch videos, hang out with friends, play video games and eat.</p>
 <br>
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">I also love music, especially KPOP. My favorite boygroup is GOT7, which you can find their picture and music video on my home page.</p>
<br>
<p style="color:SlateBlue;">Digital Fabrication and Engineering is the best ;)
